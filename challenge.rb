# CHALLENGE 1: write an if statement and then a ternary statement to determine how much you should pay for your cab.  If it is a trip under 5 miles, you own $10.  If it is a trip over 5 miles, you will owe $1 per mile + a base far of $5. For example, if you take a 10 mile trip, it will cost (10 * $1 + $5) = $15.


def cab_cost(miles)
    # if miles are under 5
    # if miles <= 5
    #    puts "$10"
    # else
    #   puts  "$#{miles+5}"
    # end


    # condtion ?  what to do if true  : what to do if false
    cost = miles <= 5 ? "$10" : "$#{miles+5}"
    puts cost

end




  # What the test will run:
  cab_cost(4)     # --> return $10
  cab_cost(15)    # --> return $20
  cab_cost(12)    # --> return $17
