# Write a speak_to_grandma method.

# Whatever you say to grandma, she should respond with
# HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
# unless you shout it (type in all capitals).

# If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) 
# and yells back

# NO, NOT SINCE 1938!

# However if you say 'I LOVE YOU GRANDMA!', she should respond with
# 'I LOVE YOU TOO PUMPKIN!'

#Write a speak_to_grandma method.
#The method should take in a string argument containing a phrase and 
#check to see if the phrase is written in all uppercase: if it isn't, then grandma can't hear you. 
#She should then respond with (return) HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!.
#If you shout at her (i.e. call the method with a string argument containing a phrase that is all uppercase,
#then she can hear you (or at least she thinks that she can) and should respond with 
#(return) NO, NOT SINCE 1938!.
#However, if the phrase is exactly equal to: "I LOVE YOU GRANDMA!", 
#then Grandma is very pleased and definitely hears that! and should repond with 
#(return) I LOVE YOU TOO PUMPKIN!
